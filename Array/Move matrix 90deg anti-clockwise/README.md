# Rotate by 90 degree
Given a square matrix `mat[][]` of size `n x n`. The task is to rotate it by **90 degrees** in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.
### Example
```
Input  : [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]
Output : [[3, 6, 9],
          [2, 5, 8],
          [1, 4, 7]]
